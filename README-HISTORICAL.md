This repository contains source code of the server side components of Estonian
internet-voting system for following elections:

  * 2015: Riigikogu Elections (1.03)
  * 2014: EU Parliament Elections (25.05)
  * 2013: Municipal Elections (20.10)

The code is published for public review.

The repository is not used for active development, but will be kept up to date,
so the code that can be found here is the code that is used for election. As
the voting system used for legally binding elections must strictly follow the
legislation, the actual development of Estonian i-voting system is supervised
by State Electoral Office (http://www.vvk.ee/).

Additional information on the source code can be found on the State Electoral Office website:
